# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

This is a terminal based application that allows the user to view a database of employees, their departments, roles and managers. It allows them also to add departments, roles, and employees, and update an employee role. 

## Usage

Ensure that you have node.js and all the dependencies installed. Make sure you've run the schema.sql and seeds.sql as well (I use PostGres). Then enter node index.js in the terminal.
